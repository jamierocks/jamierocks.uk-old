Yesterday it was announced that State Of Sponge Four will be rescheduled to Saturday the 6th of June.
It was rescheduled to allow it to be a month prior to Minecon.

You can find more information regarding the reschedule on their [post](https://forums.spongepowered.org/t/status-update-24-may-2015/7385).

I will still watch the stream, and play on any test server.
