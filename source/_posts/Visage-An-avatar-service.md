Not very long ago Lapitar was deprecated in favour of Visage.

Visage is not only a successor to Lapitar, it is also a lot better than Lapitar.
This is because of better code, and Visage is backed by better servers.

Visage like most other avatar services, comes with a variety of different modes. Visage is no exception!

Firstly there is face. Face is a very simple 2D face view.
Next there is head. Head is a perspective 3D head view.
There is also bust. Bust is a 3D bust view of the player.
You also have full. Full is a full 3D view of the player.
Lastly you have skin. Skin is... the skin.

Visage is the best skin service I have used, and I strongly recommend you [check](https://visage.gameminers.com/) it out.
