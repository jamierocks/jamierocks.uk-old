Once again SpongePowered have announced their next State Of Sponge, and like last time I will make a blog post about it.
In case you don't know what State of Sponge is it is where the Sponge team come together to talk about their progress in a nice ~2 hour live stream.
There is usually a demo server, running the latest build of Sponge, showcasing community and sponge-made plugins.

The stream should be available on [twitch.tv/SpongePoweredMC](http://www.twitch.tv/SpongePoweredMC), however it is recommended you follow them on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/spongepowered) in case this changes.
Permitting the server isn't as unstable as last time, I will be on there enjoying whatever the Sponge team has created.

The date has since been rescheduled - read more [here](/2015/05/25/Changes-to-SOS4/).

You can find more information about State Of Sponge Four on their [post](https://forums.spongepowered.org/t/sponge-status-update-17-may-2015).

Beyond State of Sponge they have made their Minecon submission public.
Hopefully they will get their place in Minecon as they so rightfully deserve.
