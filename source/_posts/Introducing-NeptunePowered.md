## What is [NeptunePowered](http://www.neptunepowered.org/)?
  NeptunePowered prides ourselves around providing the best Minecraft can offer.
  We accomplish this by taking the best of Minecraft today, and adapt it for tomorrow.
  Currently we are working on the Neptune suite of software, described below.

## What do we make?
  NeptunePowered produces three pieces of software:
  
  - [Neptune](https://github.com/NeptunePowered/Neptune)
  - [Arno](https://github.com/NeptunePowered/Arno)
  - [Jupiter](https://github.com/NeptunePowered/Jupiter)
    
## What is Neptune?
  Neptune is an implementation of [CanaryLib](http://canarymod.net/) for 'vanilla' Minecraft.
  You may think this is exactly the same as CanaryMod, however the two differ in the way they are implemented.
  
## What is Arno
  Arno is an implementation of [CanaryLib](http://canarymod.net/) for [Minecraft Forge](http://www.minecraftforge.net/).
  
## What is Jupiter?
  Jupiter is an implementation of [SpongeAPI](https://www.spongepowered.org/) for [CanaryLib](http://canarymod.net/).
