## What is [NeptunePowered](http://www.neptunepowered.org/)?
  At NeptunePowered, we pride ourselves around providing the best Minecraft can offer.
  We accomplish this by taking the best of Minecraft today, and adapting it for tomorrow.
  Currently we are working on the Neptune suite of software, described below.

## What do we do?
  NeptunePowered maintains three pieces of software:

  - [NeptuneVanilla](https://github.com/NeptunePowered/NeptuneVanilla)
  - [NeptuneForge](https://github.com/NeptunePowered/NeptuneForge)
  - [NeptuneLib](https://github.com/NeptunePowered/NeptuneLib)
    
## What is NeptuneVanilla?
  NeptuneVanilla is an implementation of [CanaryLib](http://canarymod.net/) for 'vanilla' Minecraft.
  You may think this is exactly the same as CanaryMod, however the two differ in the way they are implemented.
  
## What is NeptuneForge?
  NeptuneForge is an implementation of [CanaryLib](http://canarymod.net/) for [Minecraft Forge](http://www.minecraftforge.net/).
  
## What is Neptunelib?
  NeptuneLib is an extension to CanaryLib, designed to aid the development of plugins.
  NeptuneLib will be distributed as a plugin to encourage small sized plugins.
  
## What about Arno?
  Arno has been used as the basis for NeptuneForge. Lots of code has also been merged into NeptuneCommon.
