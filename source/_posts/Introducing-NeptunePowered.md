## What is [NeptunePowered](http://www.neptunepowered.org/)?
  NeptunePowered is all about providing the best Minecraft can offer.
  We accomplish this by taking the best of Minecraft today, and preparing it for tomorrow.
  Currently we are working on Neptune, described below.

## What do we do?
  Neptune currently develops the following:

  - [NeptuneVanilla](https://github.com/NeptunePowered/NeptuneVanilla)
  - [NeptuneForge](https://github.com/NeptunePowered/NeptuneForge)
  - [NeptuneLib](https://github.com/NeptunePowered/NeptuneLib)
    
## What is NeptuneVanilla?
  NeptuneVanilla is an implementation of [CanaryLib](http://canarymod.net/) for 'vanilla' Minecraft.
  Doing the same thing as CanaryMod, NeptuneVanilla differs in implementation and how closely it resembles 'vanilla' Minecraft.
  
## What is NeptuneForge?
  NeptuneForge is an implementation of [CanaryLib](http://canarymod.net/) for [Minecraft Forge](http://www.minecraftforge.net/).
  
## What is NeptuneLib?
  NeptuneLib is an extension to CanaryLib, designed to aid the development of plugins.
  NeptuneLib will be distributed as a plugin to encourage small sized plugins.
  
## What about Arno?
  Arno was renamed and lives on through NeptuneForge.
  Little change was made during the transition to Neptune. The major one being it is now powered by NeptuneCommon.
