Once again, Spigot will be exhibiting at Minecon. It was announced last [saturday](http://www.spigotmc.org/threads/spigotmc-is-exhibiting-at-minecon-2015.68872/), just 35 days until the event.
This is be the second time they have exhibited at Minecon, as they also exhibited last Minecon (2013).

However exhibiting isn't cheap, and I ask you (if you can) to [donate](http://www.spigotmc.org/#donate) to them.

If you would like to find more information about Spigot's exhibition, see their [post](http://www.spigotmc.org/threads/minecon-2015-exhibition-info.69644/).
