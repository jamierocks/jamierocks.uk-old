Once again, Spigot will be exhibiting at Minecon. It was [announced](http://www.spigotmc.org/threads/spigotmc-is-exhibiting-at-minecon-2015.68872/) last saturday, just 35 days before the event.
This is be the second time they have exhibited at Minecon, as they also exhibited last Minecon (2013).

However exhibiting isn't cheap, and I ask you (if you can) to [donate](http://www.spigotmc.org/#donate) to them.
Throughout the past months, Spigot has kept Bukkit servers up to date and still running, even if they have done it in ways disliked by many of the community...

If you would like to find more information about Spigot's exhibition, see their [post](http://www.spigotmc.org/threads/minecon-2015-exhibition-info.69644/).
