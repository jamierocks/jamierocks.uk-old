Hello there, my name is Jamie and I am a programmer.
I mostly program for JVM languages, however I have had to work with the .NET Framework.
Starting with web development ~5 years ago I have established many skills.
Now you will find me working on [Neptune](http://www.neptunepowered.org/), or modding Minecraft in some way.

I am also a big fan of video games, although rarely get time to finish everyone.
I haven't picked a side on the PC/console debate, as I believe there are reasons to get both.
On the console side of things, I am an Xbox user, and own both an Xbox 360 and Xbox One.
Prior to sticking with Xbox, I was an avid player of my Playstation 2.

Not only that, but I am also a big fan of watching movies.
Regarding what types of movies I like:
I like crime movies.
I like racing movies.
I like movies such as Fast and Furious and The Expendables.
